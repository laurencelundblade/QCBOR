 * # QCBOR Basic Decode
 *
 * This section discusses decoding assuming familiarity with the
 * general description of this encoder-decoder in section @ref
 * Overview.
 *
 * Encoded CBOR has a tree structure where the leaf nodes are
 * non-aggregate types like integers and strings and the intermediate
 * nodes are either arrays or maps. Fundamentally, CBOR decoding is a
 * pre-order traversal of this tree with CBOR sequences a minor
 * exception. Calling QCBORDecode_GetNext() repeatedly will perform
 * this. QCBOR maintains an internal traversal cursor. It is possible
 * to decode any CBOR by only calling QCBORDecode_GetNext(), though
 * this doesn't take advantage of many QCBOR features.
 *
 * QCBORDecode_GetNext() returns a 56 byte structure called
 * @ref QCBORItem that describes the decoded item including:
 * - The data itself, integer, string, floating-point number...
 * - The label if present
 * - Unprocessed tags
 * - Nesting level
 * - Allocation type (primarily of interest for indefinite length strings)
 *
 * For strings, this structure contains a pointer and length back into
 * the original data.
 *
 * Most of the tags that QCBOR supports directly are decoded into a
 * representation in @ref QCBORItem.
 *
 * A string allocator must be used when decoding indefinite length
 * strings. See QCBORDecode_SetMemPool() or
 * QCBORDecode_SetUpAllocator(). @ref QCBORItem indicates if a string
 * was allocated with the string allocator.
 *
 * This pre-order traversal gives natural decoding of arrays where the
 * array members are taken in order. Maps can be decoded this way too,
 * but the @ref SpiffyDecode APIs that allow searching maps by label
 * are often more convenient.
 *
 * @anchor Decode-Errors-Overview
 * # Decode Errors Overview
 *
 * The simplest way to handle decoding errors is to make use of the
 * internal error tracking. The only error code check necessary is
 * at the end when QCBORDecode_Finish() is called. To do this:
 *
 * - Use QCBORDecode_VGetNext(), QCBORDecode_VPeekNext()
 *  and any or all of the functions in qcbor_spiffy_decode.h. Don't use
 *  QCBORDecode_GetNext() or QCBORDecode_PeekNext().
 * - Call QCBORDecode_Finish() and check its return code.
 * - Do not reference any decoded data until after
 *    QCBORDecode_Finish() returns success.
 *
 * Once an encoding error has been encountered, the error state is
 * entered and further decoding function calls will do nothing.  It is
 * safe to continue calling decoding functions after an error. No
 * error checking is necessary making the code to decode a protocol
 * simpler.  The two exceptions are QCBORDecode_GetNext() and
 * QCBORDecode_PeekNext() which will try to decode even if the decoder
 * is in the error state. Use QCBORDecode_VGetNext() and
 * QCBORDecode_VPeekNext() instead.
 *
 * While some protocols are simple enough to be decoded this way, many
 * arenâ€™t because the data items earlier in the protocol determine how
 * later data items are to be decoded. In that case it is necessary to
 * call QCBORDecode_GetError() to know the earlier items were
 * successfully decoded before examining their value or type.
 *
 * The internal decode error state can be reset by reinitializing the
 * decoder or calling QCBORDecode_GetErrorAndReset(). Code calling
 * QCBOR may take advantage of the internal error state to halt
 * futher decoding and propagate errors it detects using
 * QCBORDecode_SetError().
 *
 * It is only useful to reset the error state by calling
 * QCBORDecode_GetErrorAndReset() on recoverable errors. Examples of
 * recoverable errors are a map entry not being found or integer
 * overflow or underflow during conversion. Examples of unrecoverable
 * errors are hitting the end of the input and array or map nesting
 * beyond the limits of the implementation. See
 * QCBORDecode_IsUnrecoverableError().Trying to reset and decode after
 * an unrecoverable error will usually just lead to another error.
 *
 * It is possible to use QCBORDecode_GetNext() and
 * QCBORDecode_PeekNext() to decode an entire protocol. However, that is
 * usually more work, more code and less convenient than using spiffy
 * decode functions.
 *
 * It is also possible to mix the use of QCBORDecode_GetNext() with
 * QCBORDecode_VGetNext() and the spiffy decode functions, but
 * QCBORDecode_GetError() must be called and return QCBOR_SUCCESS before
 * QCBORDecode_GetNext() is called.
 *
 * The effect of a decoding error on the traversal cursor position
 * varies by the decoding method called. It is unaffected by spiffy
 * decode methods that get items by map label.
 * QCBORDecode_GetInt64InMapN() is an example of this. The traversal
 * cursor will be advanced by most other decode methods even when
 * there is a decode error, often leaving it in an indeterminate
 * position. If it is necessary to continue to decoding after an
 * error, QCBORDecode_Rewind() can be used to reset it to a known-good
 * position.
 *
 * When using spiffy decode methods to get an item by label from a map
 * the whole map is internally traversed including nested arrays and
 * maps. If there is any unrecoverable error during that traversal,
 * the retrieval by label will fail. The unrecoverable error will be
 * returned even if it is not because the item being sought is in
 * error. Recoverable errors will be ignored unless they are on the
 * item being sought, in which case the unrecoverable error will be
 * returned. Unrecoverable errors are those indicated by
 * QCBORDecode_IsUnrecoverableError().
 *
 * @anchor Disabilng-Tag-Decoding
 * # Disabilng Tag Decoding
 *
 * If QCBOR_DISABLE_TAGS is defined, all code for decoding tags will
 * be omitted reducing the core decoder, QCBORDecode_VGetNext(), by
 * about 400 bytes. If a tag number is encountered in the decoder
 * input the unrecoverable error @ref QCBOR_ERR_TAGS_DISABLED will be
 * returned.  No input with tags can be decoded.
 *
 * Decode functions like QCBORDecode_GetEpochDate() and
 * QCBORDecode_GetDecimalFraction() that can decode the tag content
 * even if the tag number is absent are still available.  Typically
 * they won't be linked in because of dead stripping. The
 * @c uTagRequirement parameter has no effect, but if it is
 * @ref QCBOR_TAG_REQUIREMENT_TAG, @ref QCBOR_ERR_TAGS_DISABLED
 * will be set.

 * @brief Prototype for the implementation of a string allocator.
 *
 * @param[in] pAllocateCxt Pointer to context for the particular
 *                         allocator implementation. Its contents
 *                         depend on how a particular string allocator
 *                         works. Typically, it will contain a pointer
 *                         to the memory pool and some booking keeping
 *                         data.
 *
 * @param[in] pOldMem      Points to some memory previously allocated
 *                         that is either to be freed or to be
 *                         reallocated to be larger. It is @c NULL for
 *                         new allocations and when called as the
 *                         destructor.
 *
 * @param[in] uNewSize     Size of memory to be allocated or new size
 *                         for a chunk being reallocated. Zero when
 *                         called to free memory or when called as the
 *                         destructor.
 *
 * @return Either the allocated buffer is returned, or
 *         @ref NULLUsefulBufC. @ref NULLUsefulBufC is returned on a
 *         failed allocation and in the two cases where there is
 *         nothing to return.
 *
 * This function must be implemented for a custom string
 * allocator. See QCBORDecode_SetUpAllocator().
 *
 * This is not needed if the built-in string allocator available
 * through QCBORDecode_SetMemPool() is used.
 *
 * After being set up by a call to QCBORDecode_SetUpAllocator(),
 * this is called back in four modes:
 *
 * - allocate: @c uNewSize is the amount to allocate. @c pOldMem is
 *  @c NULL.
 *
 * - free: @c uNewSize is 0. @c pOldMem points to the memory to be
 * freed.  When the decoder calls this, it will always be for the most
 * recent block that was either allocated or reallocated.
 *
 * - reallocate: @c pOldMem is the block to reallocate. @c uNewSize is
 * its new size.  When the decoder calls this, it will always be for the
 * most recent block that was either allocated or reallocated.
 *
 * - destruct: @c pOldMem is @c NULL and @c uNewSize is 0. This is
 * called when the decoding is complete by
 * QCBORDecode_Finish(). Usually, the strings allocated by a string
 * allocator are in use after the decoding is completed so this
 * usually will not free those strings. Many string allocators will
 * not need to do anything in this mode.
 *
 * The strings allocated by this will have @c uDataAlloc set to true
 * in the @ref QCBORItem when they are returned. The user of the
 * strings will have to free them. How they free them, depends on the
 * design of the string allocator.

 * Indefinite-length strings (text and byte) cannot be decoded unless

 *
 * The memory pool must be @ref QCBOR_DECODE_MIN_MEM_POOL_SIZE plus

 * it the same size as the CBOR being decoded plus @ref

 *
 * This memory pool is used for all indefinite-length strings that are
 * text strings or byte strings, including strings used as labels.

 * The pointers to strings in @ref QCBORItem will point into the
 * memory pool set here. They do not need to be individually
 * freed. Just discard the buffer when they are no longer needed.
 *
 * If @c bAllStrings is set, then the size will be the overhead plus
 * the space to hold **all** strings, definite and indefinite-length,
 * value or label. The advantage of this is that after the decode is
 * complete, the original memory holding the encoded CBOR does not
 * need to remain valid.
 *
 * This simple allocator is not hard linked to the QCBOR decoder.
 * Assuming dead-stripping of unused symbols is being performed, this
 * simple allocator will not be linked in unless

 * @c pDecodedItem is filled from the decoded item. Generally, the

 *
 * - @c uDataType which indicates which member of the @c val union the
 *   data is in. This decoder figures out the type based on the CBOR
 *   major type, the CBOR "additionalInfo", the CBOR optional tags and

 * - The value of the item, which might be an integer, a pointer and a

 *   other.
 *
 * - The nesting level for maps and arrays.
 *
 * - The label for an item in a map, which may be a text or byte string
 *   or an integer.
 *
 * - The unprocessed tag numbers for which the item is the tag content.
 *
 * See @ref QCBORItem for all the details about what is returned.
 *
 * This function handles arrays and maps. When an array or map is
 * first encountered a @ref QCBORItem will be returned with major type
 * @ref QCBOR_TYPE_ARRAY or @ref QCBOR_TYPE_MAP.  @c
 * QCBORItem.val.uNestLevel gives the nesting level of the opening of
 * the array or map. When the next item is fetched, it will be the
 * first one in the array or map and its @c QCBORItem.val.uNestLevel
 * will be one more than that of the opening of the array or map.
 *
 * Nesting level 0 is the top-most nesting level. The first item
 * decoded always has nesting level 0. A map or array at the top level
 * has nesting level 0 and the members of the array or map have
 * nesting level 1.

 *
 * @code
 * Data Item           Nesting Level
 * integer                     0
 * array with 2 items          0

 *    byte string              1

 * @endcode
 *
 * Here's a more complex example that is not a CBOR sequence
 *
 * @code
 * Data Item           Nesting Level
 * map with 4 items            0
 *    text string              1
 *    array with 3 integers    1

 *    byte string              1
 * @endcode
 *
 * In @ref QCBORItem, @c uNextNestLevel is the nesting level for the
 * next call to QCBORDecode_VGetNext(). It indicates if any maps or
 * arrays were closed out during the processing of the just-fetched
 * @ref QCBORItem. This processing includes a look-ahead for any
 * breaks that close out indefinite-length arrays or maps. This value
 * is needed to be able to understand the hierarchical structure. If
 * @c uNextNestLevel is not equal to @c uNestLevel the end of the
 * current map or array has been encountered. This works for both
 * definite and indefinite-length arrays so it is the best way to find the
 * end of a map or array. Alternatively, for definite-length arrays,
 * @c QCBORItem.val.uCount contains the number of items in the
 * array. For indefinite-length arrays, @c QCBORItem.val.uCount
 * is @c UINT16_MAX.
 *
 * See extensive discussion in @ref Tag-Decoding.
 *
 * See [Decode Error Overview](#Decode-Errors-Overview).
 *
 * If a decoding error occurs or previously occured, @c uDataType and
 * @c uLabelType will be set to @ref QCBOR_TYPE_NONE. If there is no
 * need to know the specific error, it is sufficient to check for @ref
 * QCBOR_TYPE_NONE.
 *
 * Errors fall in several categories:
 *
 * - Not well-formed errors are those where there is something
 *   syntactically and fundamentally wrong with the CBOR being
 *   decoded. Decoding should stop completely.
 *
 * - Invalid CBOR is well-formed, but still not correct. It is
 *   probably best to stop decoding, but not necessary.
 *
 * - This implementation has some size limits. They should rarely be
 *   encountered. If they are it may because something is wrong with
 *   the CBOR, for example an array size is incorrect.
 *
 * - There are a few CBOR constructs that are not handled without some
 *   extra configuration. These are indefinite length strings and maps
 *   with labels that are not strings or integers. See
 *   QCBORDecode_Init().  Also, the QCBOR library may have been
 *   compiled with some features disabled to reduce code size and this
 *   can result in some errors.
 *
 * - Resource exhaustion. This only occurs when a string allocator is
 *   configured to handle indefinite-length strings as other than
 *   that, this implementation does no dynamic memory allocation.

 *

 *
 * This exists to process an item that is expected to be a big number

 * of the main decoding because of the number of CBOR types it
 * involves, because it needs a buffer to output to, and to keep code
 * size of the core decoding small.
 *
 * This can also be used to do the subtraction of 1 for negative big
 * numbers even if preferred serialization of big numbers is not in
 * use.
 *
 * This works on all CBOR type 0 and 1 integers and all tag 2 and 3
 * big numbers.  In terms of QCBOR types, this works on
 * \ref QCBOR_TYPE_INT64, \ref QCBOR_TYPE_UINT64,
 * \ref QCBOR_TYPE_65BIT_NEG, \ref QCBOR_TYPE_POSBIGNUM and
 * \ref QCBOR_TYPE_NEGBIGNUM. This also works on
 * \ref QCBOR_TYPE_BYTES in which case pIsNegative
 * becomes an in parameter indicating the sign.
 *
 * This always returns the result as a big number. The integer types 0
 * and 1 are converted. Leading zeros are removed. The value 0 is
 * always returned as a one-byte big number with the value 0x00.
 *
 * If \c BigNumberBuf is too small, \c pBigNum.ptr will be \c NULL and \c
 * pBigNum.len reports the required length. The size of \c BigNumberBuf
 * might have to be one larger than the size of the tag 2 or 3 being
 * decode because of two cases. In CBOR the value of a tag 3 big
 * number is -n - 1. The subtraction of one might have a carry.  For
 * example, an encoded tag 3 that is 0xff, is returned here as 0x01
 * 0x00.  The other case is a empty tag 2 which is returned as a
 * one-byte big number with the value 0x00.  (This is the only place
 * in all of RFC 8949 except for indefinite length strings where the
 * encoded buffer off the wire can't be returned directly, the only
 * place some storage allocation is required.)
 *
 * This is the decode-side implementation of preferred serialization
 * of big numbers described in section 3.4.3 of RFC 8949. It
 * implements the decode-side unification of big numbers and regular
 * integers.
 *
 * This can also be used if you happen to want type 0 and type 1
 * integers converted to big numbers.
 *
 * See also QCBORDecode_ProcessBigNumberNoPreferred().
 *
 * If QCBOR is being used in an environment with a full big number
 * library, it may be better (less object code) to use the big number
 * library than this, particularly to subtract one for tag 3.
 *
 * Finally, the object code for this function is suprisingly large,
 * almost 1KB. This is due to the number of CBOR data types, and the

 *
 * CBOR itself doesn't size the individual integers it carries at

 * are 8 bytes or less in length. Then encoders like this one use the
 * smallest number of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes to represent the integer based
 * on its value. There is thus no notion that one data item in CBOR is
 * a 1-byte integer and another is a 4-byte integer.
 *
 * The interface to this CBOR encoder only uses 64-bit integers. Some
 * CBOR protocols or implementations of CBOR protocols may not want to
 * work with something smaller than a 64-bit integer.  Perhaps an array
 * of 1,000 integers needs to be sent and none has a value larger than
 * 50,000 and are represented as @c uint16_t.
 *
 * The sending / encoding side is easy. Integers are temporarily widened
 * to 64-bits as a parameter passing through QCBOREncode_AddInt64() and
 * encoded in the smallest way possible for their value, possibly in
 * less than an @c uint16_t.
 *
 * On the decoding side the integers will be returned at @c int64_t even if
 * they are small and were represented by only 1 or 2 bytes in the
 * encoded CBOR. The functions here will convert integers to a small
 * representation with an overflow check.
 *
 * (The decoder could have support 8 different integer types and
 * represented the integer with the smallest type automatically, but
 * this would have made the decoder more complex and code calling the
 * decoder more complex in most use cases.  In most use cases on 64-bit
