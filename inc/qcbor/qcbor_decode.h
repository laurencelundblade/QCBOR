 # QCBOR Basic Decode

 This section just discusses decoding assuming familiarity with the
 general description of this encoder / decoder in section @ref
 Overview.

 Encoded CBOR can be viewed to have a tree structure where the leaf
 nodes are non-aggregate types like integers and strings and the
 intermediate nodes are either arrays or maps. Fundamentally, all CBOR
 decoding is a pre-order traversal of the tree. Calling
 QCBORDecode_GetNext() repeatedly will perform this. It is possible to
 decode any CBOR by only calling QCBORDecode_GetNext().

 QCBORDecode_GetNext() returns a 56 byte structure called
 @ref QCBORItem that describes the decoded item including
 - The data itself, integer, string, floating-point number...
 - The label if present
 - Unprocessed tags
 - Nesting level
 - Allocation type (primarily of interest for indefinite length strings)

 For strings, this structure contains a pointer and length
 back into the original data.

 All of the tags that QCBOR supports directly are decoded into a
 representation in @ref QCBORItem.

 A string allocator must be used when decoding indefinite length
 strings. See QCBORDecode_SetMemPool() or
 QCBORDecode_SetUpAllocator(). @ref QCBORItem indicates if a string
 was allocated with the string allocator.

 This pre-order traversal gives natural decoding of arrays where the
 array members are taken in order, but does not give natural decoding
 of maps where access by label is usually preferred.  See
 @ref SpiffyDecode for APIs to search maps by label and much more.

  @brief The type defining what a string allocator function must do.

  @param[in] pAllocateCxt  Pointer to context for the particular
                            allocator implementation What is in the
                            context is dependent on how a particular
                            string allocator works. Typically, it
                            will contain a pointer to the memory pool
                            and some booking keeping data.
 @param[in] pOldMem         Points to some memory allocated by the
                            allocator that is either to be freed or
                            to be reallocated to be larger. It is
                            @c NULL for new allocations and when called as
                            a destructor to clean up the whole
                            allocation.
 @param[in] uNewSize        Size of memory to be allocated or new
                            size of chunk to be reallocated. Zero for
                            a new allocation or when called as a
                            destructor.

 @return   Either the allocated buffer is returned, or @ref
           NULLUsefulBufC. @ref NULLUsefulBufC is returned on a failed
           allocation and in the two cases where there is nothing to
           return.

 This is called in one of four modes:

 Allocate -- @c uNewSize is the amount to allocate. @c pOldMem is @c
 NULL.

 Free -- @c uNewSize is 0. @c pOldMem points to the memory to be
 freed.  When the decoder calls this, it will always be the most
 recent block that was either allocated or reallocated.

 Reallocate -- @c pOldMem is the block to reallocate. @c uNewSize is
 its new size.  When the decoder calls this, it will always be the
 most recent block that was either allocated or reallocated.

 Destruct -- @c pOldMem is @c NULL and @c uNewSize is 0. This is called
 when the decoding is complete by QCBORDecode_Finish(). Usually the
 strings allocated by a string allocator are in use after the decoding
 is completed so this usually will not free those strings. Many string
 allocators will not need to do anything in this mode.

 The strings allocated by this will have @c uDataAlloc set to true in
 the @ref QCBORItem when they are returned. The user of the strings
 will have to free them. How they free them, depends on the string
 allocator.

 If QCBORDecode_SetMemPool() is called, the internal MemPool will be
 used. It has its own internal implementation of this function, so
 one does not need to be implemented.

 Initialize context for a pre-order traversal of the encoded CBOR

 Most CBOR decoding can be completed by calling this function to start
 and QCBORDecode_GetNext() in a loop.

 If indefinite-length strings are to be decoded, then
 QCBORDecode_SetMemPool() or QCBORDecode_SetUpAllocator() must be
 called to set up a string allocator.

 If tags other than built-in tags are to be recognized and recorded in
 @c uTagBits, then QCBORDecode_SetCallerConfiguredTagList() must be
 called. The built-in tags are those for which a macro of the form @c
 CBOR_TAG_XXX is defined.

 Three decoding modes are supported.  In normal mode, @ref
 QCBOR_DECODE_MODE_NORMAL, maps are decoded and strings and integers
 are accepted as map labels. If a label is other than these, the error
 @ref QCBOR_ERR_MAP_LABEL_TYPE is returned by QCBORDecode_GetNext().

 In strings-only mode, @ref QCBOR_DECODE_MODE_MAP_STRINGS_ONLY, only
 text strings are accepted for map labels.  This lines up with CBOR
 that converts to JSON. The error @ref QCBOR_ERR_MAP_LABEL_TYPE is
 returned by QCBORDecode_GetNext() if anything but a text string label
 is encountered.

 In @ref QCBOR_DECODE_MODE_MAP_AS_ARRAY maps are treated as special
 arrays.  They will be return with special @c uDataType @ref
 QCBOR_TYPE_MAP_AS_ARRAY and @c uCount, the number of items, will be
 double what it would be for a normal map because the labels are also
 counted. This mode is useful for decoding CBOR that has labels that
 are not integers or text strings, but the caller must manage much of
 the map decoding.

 indefinite-length strings (text and byte) cannot be decoded unless
 there is a string allocator configured. MemPool is a simple built-in
 string allocator that allocates bytes from a memory pool handed to it
 by calling this function.  The memory pool is just a pointer and
 length for some block of memory that is to be used for string
 allocation. It can come from the stack, heap or other.

 The memory pool must be @ref QCBOR_DECODE_MIN_MEM_POOL_SIZE plus
 space for all the strings allocated.  There is no overhead per string
 allocated. A conservative way to size this buffer is to make it the
 same size as the CBOR being decoded plus @ref
 QCBOR_DECODE_MIN_MEM_POOL_SIZE.

 This memory pool is used for all indefinite-length strings that are
 text strings or byte strings, including strings used as labels.

 The pointers to strings in @ref QCBORItem will point into the memory
 pool set here. They do not need to be individually freed. Just
 discard the buffer when they are no longer needed.

 If @c bAllStrings is set, then the size will be the overhead plus the
 space to hold **all** strings, definite and indefinite-length, value
 or label. The advantage of this is that after the decode is complete,
 the original memory holding the encoded CBOR does not need to remain
 valid.

 If this function is never called because there is no need to support
 indefinite-length strings, the internal MemPool implementation should
 be dead-stripped by the loader and not add to code size.

 indefinite-length strings (text and byte) cannot be decoded unless
 there a string allocator is configured. QCBORDecode_SetUpAllocator()
 allows the caller to configure an external string allocator
 implementation if the internal string allocator is not suitable. See
 QCBORDecode_SetMemPool() to configure the internal allocator. Note
 that the internal allocator is not automatically set up.

 The string allocator configured here can be a custom one designed and
 implemented by the caller.  See @ref QCBORStringAllocate for the
 requirements for a string allocator implementation.

 A malloc-based string external allocator can be obtained by calling
 @c QCBORDecode_MakeMallocStringAllocator(). It will return a function
 and pointer that can be given here as @c pAllocatorFunction and @c
 pAllocatorContext. It uses standard @c malloc() so @c free() must be
 called on all strings marked by @c uDataAlloc @c == @c 1 or @c
 uLabelAlloc @c == @c 1 in @ref QCBORItem.

 Note that an older version of this function took an allocator
 structure, rather than single function and pointer.  The older
 version @c QCBORDecode_MakeMallocStringAllocator() also implemented
 the older interface.

 @retval QCBOR_ERR_NO_MORE_ITEMS   No more bytes to decode. The previous
                                   item was successfully decoded. This
                                   is usually how the non-error end of
                                   a CBOR stream / sequence is detected.

 @c pDecodedItem is filled in with the value parsed. Generally, the
 following data is returned in the structure:

 - @c uDataType which indicates which member of the @c val union the
   data is in. This decoder figures out the type based on the CBOR
   major type, the CBOR "additionalInfo", the CBOR optional tags and
   the value of the integer.

 - The value of the item, which might be an integer, a pointer and a
   length, the count of items in an array, a floating-point number or
   other.

 - The nesting level for maps and arrays.

 - The label for an item in a map, which may be a text or byte string
   or an integer.

 - The CBOR optional tag or tags.

 See documentation on in the data type @ref _QCBORItem for all the
 details on what is returned.

 This function handles arrays and maps. When first encountered a @ref
 QCBORItem will be returned with major type @ref QCBOR_TYPE_ARRAY or
 @ref QCBOR_TYPE_MAP. @c QCBORItem.val.uCount will indicate the number
 of Items in the array or map.  Typically, an implementation will call
 QCBORDecode_GetNext() in a for loop to fetch them all. When decoding
 indefinite-length maps and arrays, @c QCBORItem.val.uCount is @c
 UINT16_MAX and @c uNextNestLevel must be used to know when the end of
 a map or array is reached.

 Nesting level 0 is the outside top-most nesting level. For example,
 in a CBOR structure with two items, an integer and a byte string
 only, both would be at nesting level 0.  A CBOR structure with an
 array open, an integer and a byte string, would have the integer and
 byte string as nesting level 1.

 Here is an example of how the nesting level is reported with no arrays
 or maps at all.

 @verbatim
 CBOR Structure           Nesting Level
 Integer                    0
 Byte String                0
 @endverbatim

 Here is an example of how the nesting level is reported with a simple
 array and some top-level items.

 @verbatim
 Integer                    0
 Array (with 2 items)       0
 Byte String                1
 Byte string                1
 Integer                    0
 @endverbatim


 Here's a more complex example
 @verbatim

 Map with 2 items           0
 Text string                1
 Array with 3 integers      1
 integer                    2
 integer                    2
 integer                    2
 text string                1
 byte string                1
 @endverbatim

 In @ref _QCBORItem, @c uNextNestLevel is the nesting level for the
 next call to QCBORDecode_GetNext(). It indicates if any maps or
 arrays were closed out during the processing of the just-fetched @ref
 QCBORItem. This processing includes a look-ahead for any breaks that
 close out indefinite-length arrays or maps. This value is needed to
 be able to understand the hierarchical structure. If @c
 uNextNestLevel is not equal to @c uNestLevel the end of the current
 map or array has been encountered. This works the same for both
 definite and indefinite-length arrays.

 QCBOR will automatically decode all the tags defined in RFC 8949
 plus a few more. They will show up in a QCBORItem as QCBOR types
 like QCBOR_TYPE_POS_BIGNUM.

 Most tags with a CBOR_TAG_XXX define in qcbor_common.h like @ref
 CBOR_TAG_DATE_STRING are automaticlly decoded by QCBOR. Those that
 are defined but not decoded are so noted.

 Tags that are not decoded by QCBOR will be identified and recorded in
 a QCBORItem. Use QCBORDecode_GetNthTag() to get them. Only @ref
 QCBOR_MAX_TAGS_PER_ITEM tags are recorded per item and an error is
 returned if there are more than that.

 Previous versions of QCBOR handled tags in a more complex way using
 QCBORDecode_SetCallerConfiguredTagList() and
 QCBORDecode_GetNextWithTags().  This is largely compatible, but
 imposes the limit of @ref QCBOR_MAX_TAGS_PER_ITEM tags per item

 See @ref Tags-Overview for a description of how to go about creating
 custom tags.

 This tag decoding design is to be open-ended and flexible to be able
 to handle newly defined tags, while using very little memory, in
 particular keeping @ref QCBORItem as small as possible.

 If any error occurs, \c uDataType and \c uLabelType will be set
 to @ref QCBOR_TYPE_NONE. If there is no need to know the specific
 error, @ref QCBOR_TYPE_NONE can be checked for and the return value
 ignored.

 Errors fall in several categories as noted in list above:

 - Not well-formed errors are those where there is something
 syntactically and fundamentally wrong with the CBOR being
 decoded. Encoding should stop completely.

 - Invalid CBOR is well-formed, but still not correct. It is probably
 best to stop decoding, but not necessary.

 - This implementation has some size limits. They should rarely be
 encountered. If they are it may because something is wrong with the
 CBOR, for example an array size is incorrect.

 - Resource exhaustion. This only occurs when a string allocator is
 configured to handle indefinite-length strings as other than that,
 this implementation does no dynamic memory allocation.

 - There are a few CBOR constructs that are not handled without some
 extra configuration. These are indefinite length strings and maps
 with labels that are not strings or integers. See QCBORDecode_Init().

 This does not set the internal error code or cease to function when
 it is set. The error returned must always be checked. See also
 QCBORDecode_VGetNext().

 @brief Get the decoding error.

 All decoding functions set a saved internal error when they fail.
 Most decoding functions do not return an error. To know the error,
 this function must be called.

 The intended use is that decoding functions can be called one
 after another with no regard to error until either the whole
 decode is finished or some data returned from the decode must
 be referenced. This makes implementations of protocols much
 cleaner and prettier. For simple protocols the only error check
 may be the return code from QCBORDecode_Finish().

 Once a decoding error has occured most decode functions will do
 nothing if called. QCBORDecode_GetNext() is an exception.

 The implementation of this is just an inline accessor function
 so its use adds very little object code.

 Note that no reference to the decoded data should be made until
 after QCBORDecode_Finish() is called as it will not be valid
 after a decoding error has occured.

 This will not work for protocols where the expected data items
 depend on preceding data items existence, type, label or value.
 In that case call this function to see there is no error
 before examining data items before QCBORDecode_Finish() is
 called.

 Some errors, like integer conversion overflow, date string
 format may not affect the flow of a protocol. The protocol
 decoder may wish to proceed even if they occur. In that case
 QCBORDecode_GetAndResetError() may be called after these
 data items are fetched.

 @brief Convert int64_t to smaller integers safely.

 @param [in]  src   An @c int64_t.

 @return 0 on success -1 if not

 When decoding an integer, the CBOR decoder will return the value as
 an int64_t unless the integer is in the range of @c INT64_MAX and @c
 UINT64_MAX. That is, unless the value is so large that it can only be
 represented as a @c uint64_t, it will be an @c int64_t.

 CBOR itself doesn't size the individual integers it carries at
 all. The only limits it puts on the major integer types is that they
 are 8 bytes or less in length. Then encoders like this one use the
 smallest number of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes to represent the integer based
 on its value. There is thus no notion that one data item in CBOR is
 a 1-byte integer and another is a 4-byte integer.

 The interface to this CBOR encoder only uses 64-bit integers. Some
 CBOR protocols or implementations of CBOR protocols may not want to
 work with something smaller than a 64-bit integer.  Perhaps an array
 of 1000 integers needs to be sent and none has a value larger than
 50,000 and are represented as @c uint16_t.

 The sending / encoding side is easy. Integers are temporarily widened
 to 64-bits as a parameter passing through QCBOREncode_AddInt64() and
 encoded in the smallest way possible for their value, possibly in
 less than an @c uint16_t.

 On the decoding side the integers will be returned at @c int64_t even if
 they are small and were represented by only 1 or 2 bytes in the
 encoded CBOR. The functions here will convert integers to a small
 representation with an overflow check.

 (The decoder could have support 8 different integer types and
 represented the integer with the smallest type automatically, but
 this would have made the decoder more complex and code calling the
 decoder more complex in most use cases.  In most use cases on 64-bit
 machines it is no burden to carry around even small integers as
 64-bit values).
