/*
 Nesting -- This tracks the nesting of maps and arrays.

 The following functions and data type QCBORTrackNesting implement the
 nesting management for encoding.

 CBOR's two nesting types, arrays and maps, are tracked here. There is
 a limit of QCBOR_MAX_ARRAY_NESTING to the number of arrays and maps
 that can be nested in one encoding so the encoding context stays
 small enough to fit on the stack.

 When an array / map is opened, pCurrentNesting points to the element
 in pArrays that records the type, start position and accumulates a
 count of the number of items added. When closed the start position is
 used to go back and fill in the type and number of items in the array
 / map.

 Encoded output can be just items like ints and strings that are not
 part of any array / map. That is, the first thing encoded does not
 have to be an array or a map.

 QCBOR has a special feature to allow constructing bstr-wrapped CBOR
 directly into the output buffer, so an extra buffer for it is not
 needed.  This is implemented as nesting with type
 CBOR_MAJOR_TYPE_BYTE_STRING and uses this code. Bstr-wrapped CBOR is
 used by COSE for data that is to be hashed.

/*
 Error tracking plan -- Errors are tracked internally and not returned
 until QCBOREncode_Finish is called. The CBOR errors are in me->uError.
 UsefulOutBuf also tracks whether the buffer is full or not in its
 context.  Once either of these errors is set they are never
 cleared. Only QCBOREncode_Init() resets them. Or said another way, they must
 never be cleared or we'll tell the caller all is good when it is not.

 Only one error code is reported by QCBOREncode_Finish() even if there are
 multiple errors. The last one set wins. The caller might have to fix
 one error to reveal the next one they have to fix.  This is OK.

 The buffer full error tracked by UsefulBuf is only pulled out of
 UsefulBuf in Finish() so it is the one that usually wins.  UsefulBuf
 will never go off the end of the buffer even if it is called again
 and again when full.

 It is really tempting to not check for overflow on the count in the
 number of items in an array. It would save a lot of code, it is
 extremely unlikely that any one will every put 65,000 items in an
 array, and the only bad thing that would happen is the CBOR would be
 bogus.

 Since this does not parse any input, you could in theory remove all
 error checks in this code if you knew the caller called it
 correctly. Maybe someday CDDL or some such language will be able to
 generate the code to call this and the calling code would always be
 correct. This could also automatically size some of the data
 structures like array/map nesting resulting in some stack memory
 savings.

 The 8 errors returned here fall into three categories:

 Sizes
   QCBOR_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_LARGE        -- Encoded output exceeded UINT32_MAX
   QCBOR_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL        -- Output buffer too small
   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_NESTING_TOO_DEEP  -- Nesting > QCBOR_MAX_ARRAY_NESTING1
   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_TOO_LONG          -- Too many things added to an array/map

 Nesting constructed incorrectly
   QCBOR_ERR_TOO_MANY_CLOSES         -- More close calls than opens
   QCBOR_ERR_CLOSE_MISMATCH          -- Type of close does not match open
   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_OR_MAP_STILL_OPEN -- Finish called without enough closes

 Would generate not-well-formed CBOR
   QCBOR_ERR_ENCODE_UNSUPPORTED      -- Simple type between 24 and 31

    All CBOR data items have a type and an "argument". The argument is
    either the value of the item for integer types, the length of the
    content for string, byte, array and map types, a tag for major type
    6, and has several uses for major type 7.

    This function encodes the type and the argument. There are several
    encodings for the argument depending on how large it is and how it is
    used.

    Every encoding of the type and argument has at least one byte, the
    "initial byte".

    The top three bits of the initial byte are the major type for the
    CBOR data item.  The eight major types defined by the standard are
    defined as CBOR_MAJOR_TYPE_xxxx in qcbor/qcbor_common.h.

    The remaining five bits, known as "additional information", and
    possibly more bytes encode the argument. If the argument is less than
    24, then it is encoded entirely in the five bits. This is neat
    because it allows you to encode an entire CBOR data item in 1 byte
    for many values and types (integers 0-23, true, false, and tags).

    If the argument is larger than 24, then it is encoded in 1,2,4 or 8
    additional bytes, with the number of these bytes indicated by the
    values of the 5 bits 24, 25, 25 and 27.

    It is possible to encode a particular argument in many ways with this
    representation.  This implementation always uses the smallest
    possible representation. This conforms with CBOR preferred encoding.

    This function inserts them into the output buffer at the specified
    position. AppendEncodedTypeAndNumber() appends to the end.

    This function takes care of converting to network byte order.

    This function is also used to insert floats and doubles. Before this
    function is called the float or double must be copied into a
    uint64_t. That is how they are passed in. They are then converted to
    network byte order correctly. The uMinLen parameter makes sure that
    even if all the digits of a half, float or double are 0 it is still
    correctly encoded in 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
    */
   /*
    This code does endian conversion without hton or knowing the
    endianness of the machine using masks and shifts. This avoids the
    dependency on hton and the mess of figuring out how to find the
    machine's endianness.

    This is a good efficient implementation on little-endian machines.
    A faster and small implementation is possible on big-endian
    machines because CBOR/network byte order is big endian. However
    big endian machines are uncommon.

    On x86, it is about 200 bytes instead of 500 bytes for the more
    formal unoptimized code.

    This also does the CBOR preferred shortest encoding for integers
    and is called to do endian conversion for floats.

    It works backwards from the LSB to the MSB as needed.

   /*
    The type int is used here for several variables because of the way
    integer promotion works in C for integer variables that are
    uint8_t or uint16_t. The basic rule is that they will always be
    promoted to int if they will fit. All of these integer variables
    need only hold values less than 255 or are promoted from uint8_t,
    so they will always fit into an int. Note that promotion is only
    to unsigned int if the value won't fit into an int even if the
    promotion is for an unsigned like uint8_t.

    By declaring them int, there are few implicit conversions and fewer
    casts needed. Code size is reduced a little. It also makes static
    analyzers happier.

    Note also that declaring them uint8_t won't stop integer wrap
    around if the code is wrong. It won't make the code more correct.

 _QCBOREncode_CloseMapOrArray is larger because it has a lot
 of nesting tracking to do and much of Nesting_ inlines
 into it. It probably can't be reduced much.

 If the error returned by Nesting_Increment() can be ignored
 because the limit is so high and the consequence of exceeding
 is proved to be inconsequential, then a lot of if(me->uError)
 instance can be removed, saving some code.
