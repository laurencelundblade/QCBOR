/*
 This code is from RFC 7049/8949. It is not used in the main implementation
 because:
   a) it adds a dependency on <math.h> and ldexp().
   b) the license may be an issue

 QCBOR does support half-precision, but rather than using
 floating-point math like this, it does it with bit shifting
 and masking.

 This code is here to test that code.
